Prereq:

```bash
apt-get install zsh
apt-get install git-core
```

Getting zsh to work in ubuntu is weird, since `sh` does not understand the `source` command.  So, you do this to install zsh

    wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh

and then you change your shell to zsh

    chsh -s `which zsh`

and then restart

    sudo shutdown -r 0

This problem is explained in depth in [this issue](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues/227#issuecomment-825773)
